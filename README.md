# 1D-CNN-Nonliner-Regression
This is a 1D-CNN model built with Keras to solve regression problems (e.g. CA Housing).
The data set in the experiment is the 'California house price.csv', with 0.7 training/testing ratio. The model could be tuned by changing the first layer input shape to fit different data set.
